Country Explorer is a dynamic and interactive web application that allows users to explore detailed information about countries worldwide. The project was built as a single-page application using React, designed to offer an intuitive way to search for and learn about different countries.

Functionalities and Objectives:

With Country Explorer, users can search for any country and access key details. Logged-in users can also test their geography knowledge by playing a 10-question quiz about world capitals. The goal of the project was to create a user-friendly, visually appealing platform that makes learning about world geography simple and fun.

Technologies Used:
	•	React for building the user interface
	•	REST Countries API, Wikipedia API, Pixabay API for fetching real-time country data
	•	TypeScript for type safety and better code management
	•	CSS3 and Bootstrap for styling and responsive design
	•	Netlify for deployment
